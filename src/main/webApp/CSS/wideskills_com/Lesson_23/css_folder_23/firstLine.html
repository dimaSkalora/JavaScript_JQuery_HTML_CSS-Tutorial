<p>You can use the ::first-line pseudo-element to add a special effect to the first line of a text.You know my beauty conscious sibling paragraph will also get effected!!!</p>
<p> I am also getting effected with this pseudo element. Damn! I don't know what to do now. I should ask the designer(web) to change my look  because I don't want to look like
