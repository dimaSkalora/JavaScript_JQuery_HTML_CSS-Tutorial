<p>A British family was shocked to receive a text from their <span class=”horror”>dead grandmother</span>, who had been buried with her phone   three years earlier. Lesley Emerson died aged 59 in 2011, and was buried with her mobile phone. Her grand daughter Sheri, 22, was stunned last week to get a reply reading<span class=”horrifying”>dead grandmother</span> “I’m watching over you.”</p>
